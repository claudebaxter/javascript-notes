These are my <strong>Javascript notes</strong> I've kept from the tutorials I am studying. To use this page, set up a directory on your local machine, and download the source files from <a href=https://github.com/claudebaxter/javascript-notes title="Github Source Files"> this repository</a> (on master branch). Make sure all files are saved in the same directory, and run index.html with your browser. Turn on developer tools to observe the console results while comparing to notes.js (open in text editor like notepad or atom).


You can view the test page <a href=https://claudebaxter.github.io/javascript-notes title="Test Page"> here.</a> To use the page, open your developer tools / console to compare Javascript console log to the code.

Try copy pasting different sections of the code into your browser console and running them to help understand what each different block does.
